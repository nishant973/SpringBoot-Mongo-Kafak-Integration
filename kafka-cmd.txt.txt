Topic : A topic is a feed name to which records are published . Topics in kafka are laways multi-subscriber.
	For each topi , kafka cluster maintains a partition log.

Partitions : A topic may have many partitions so that it can handle an aribitrary amount of data.

Partition Offset : Each partiton message has a unique sequence ID called an offset.

Replicas : Backup of partitons . Used to prevent data loss . You can define replica factor and that number of replica
	   will be created and place it in cluster to avaialbe for any operations.

Brokers : Systems responsible for maintaining data . It's stateless , so they use zookeeper for maintaining their cluster state.
	  Each broker may have zero or more partitions per topic.

ZooKeeper : Used for managing and coordinating Kafka brokers. Used to notify producers and consumers if any brokers goes down or come up .

Create A Topic : 
.\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic TestTopic

List Topics : 
.\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --list --zookeeper localhost:2181

Create Producer :
.\bin\windows\kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic TestTopic

Cerate Consumer :
.\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic TestTopic --from-beginning
